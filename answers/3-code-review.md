3.1. Describe the last commit to the repository.

The last commit was made by nzjames. It changes the design mock html file `design-mock.html` to use an image of the design mock instead of a html button element and inline CSS.

3.2. What was changed?

In the design-mock.html file, the html button element (including the div elements that it is wrapped in) and the inline CSS for styling the button were replaced by a full width PNG image (a screenshot of how the final design should look).

3.3 What was the intention of this change?

The reason for this change is to make the design mock appear how the final design should look. The button in the previous design mock did not have the star/favourite icon in it, where as the PNG image does. This makes it clearer how the end result should look, even if it removes some details on how the button can be implemented with CSS.

In my opinion a Sketch file or a file from a similar screen design tool would be a better reference. This would allow the developer to find out the details such as the dimensions and border radius of the button so that it can be implemented exactly how the designer intended it to look.
